# YardenShalom-WeatherProject
responsive full stack weather tracker with AccuWeather's RESTful API

Plese note that due to AccuWeathers API there can only be made 50 calls to thier server per 24 hours. 
sadly that means that sometimes the site might not work.
if you want me to get a new API key to activate the site in this case just send me a messege in linkedin :)
